# Lobster-cooking-based-on-cooking-level
When I was 8 years old I played a came called Runescape. In Runescape the player, among many things, could fish for lobsters and attempt to cook them. The lobsters would burn less frequently based on the player's cooking level. This program takes a 50% chance of sucessfully cooking at level 0 and increments this chance with 0.5% for every additional cooking level using JavaScript promises and async await.
